Put your SD-card in the computer and write down the letter (in my case [D:\]). Download Rasbian from raspberrypi.org/downloads. When the ZIP-file is extracted you need Win32 Disk Imager. You can download it at sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/. Install and start it. Klick on the folder icon and browse to the folder where you have the Raspbian files. Make sure that the destination is the SD-card (in my case D:)
As you can see in the "Win32"-image, I'm using Raspbian Jessie.
When the write is successful, you just take the SD-card and put it in your Raspberry. Connect to the computer screen, add a mouse and keyboard, and start it.

Desctop GUI with the "pi" user. And third, choose "Internationalisation Options" and change to you own timeszone.
